# IPC 

This project consists of building a simple kernel based on a separate project about computer architecture. IPC,   Memory Management, Scheduling and Memory Protection will be implemented.

## Previous requirements

A functional computer architecture project, that is, a 64-bit monolithic kernel with basic interruption management, system calls, keyboard driver, video driver in text mode and Kernel and User Spaces separated, where device drivers can be added to the kernel as modules.

Docker is used as host development environment.

## Features

* System calls



* Physical Memory Management
* Proccesses, Threads, Context Switching y Scheduling
* Memory Protection
* IPCs
* Drivers
* Userspace applications


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installation prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

* md5sum
* openssl


### Installing

Inside IPC folder:

```
cd view && make && cd .. && make
```

Add the folder of files you wish to hash into IPC/bin.

If you wish to run on macOS:

1) Open makefile located at IPC and erase the last two libraries (lrt lpthread) from LFLAGS line. Result:
```
LFLAGS = -L /usr/local/opt/openssl/lib -lcrypto -lssl
```
2) Do the same for the makefile located at IPC/view

## Running inside IPC:

To hash files from the 'testFolder' folder:
```
cd bin && ./hash testFolder
```

To view files hashed at the moment:
```
cd bin && ./hash testFolder | ./view
```
